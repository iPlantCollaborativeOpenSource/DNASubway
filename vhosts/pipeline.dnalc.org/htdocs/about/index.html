		<p>As part of the iPlant Collaborative, the Dolan DNA Learning Center and a team of
		computer programmers have developed a workflow to make high-level genome analysis
		broadly available to biology students and teachers.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b><i>DNA Subway</i></b> is a collaborative workspace to generate DNA sequence 
		annotations, conduct phylogenetic analyses, and analyze Next-Generation Sequencing data. 
		<i>DNA Subway</i> is an appealing and intuitive interface that uses the metaphor of 
		a network of subway lines to guide users through the maze of analysis steps necessary 
		to annotate and compare DNA sequences. Developed with an eye to undergraduate education; 
		<i>DNA Subway</i> can make high-level DNA analysis available to faculty and students by 
		simplifying annotation and comparative genomics workflows.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Users can submit and analyze DNA contigs or analyze samples provided. “Riding” 
		three different lines in the <i>DNA Subway</i>, users can analyze up to 100 kb
		of DNA including conducting annotations (Red Line), building phylogenetic trees 
		(Yellow Line), and analyzing Next-Generation EST data (Blue Line). Users can generate
		gene models in a genome annotation editor (<i>Apollo</i>), view their analysis 
		results in a genome browser, and export their results to a genome hub (<i>Phytozome</i>)
		to view results in the context of information available to scientists for previously 
		sequenced genomes.</p>
