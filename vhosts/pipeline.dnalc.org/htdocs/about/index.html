		<p>As part of the iPlant Collaborative, the Dolan DNA Learning Center and a team of
		computer programmers have developed a workflow to make high-level genome analysis
		broadly available to biology students and teachers.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b><i>DNA Subway</i></b> is a collaborative workspace to generate DNA sequence 
		annotations, conduct phylogenetic analyses, and analyze Next-Generation Sequencing data. 
		<i>DNA Subway</i> is an appealing and intuitive interface that uses the metaphor of 
		a network of subway lines to guide users through the maze of analysis steps necessary 
		to annotate and compare DNA sequences. Developed with an eye to undergraduate education; 
		<i>DNA Subway</i> can make high-level DNA analysis available to faculty and students by 
		simplifying annotation and comparative genomics workflows.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Users can upload DNA sequences or work with the samples provided. “Riding” different lines in the <i>DNA Subway</i>, users can analyze up to 100 kb of DNA – predicting and annotating genes (Red Line), prospecting genomes for similar genes and building gene trees (Yellow Line). In the future, <i>DNA Subway</i> will also include lines to analyze next-generation transcriptome data and to work with phylogenetic trees.</p>
