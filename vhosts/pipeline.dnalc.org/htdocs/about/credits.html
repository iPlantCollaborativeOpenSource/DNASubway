           The text will be here soon... videography trip to Mexico to document the history of maize cultivation for our National Science Foundation-supported Internet site, Weed to Wonder. First we traveled 100 miles south of Mexico City to the Balsas River Valley, where an old man led us up shock-breaking road and obscure path to a rock shelter that took us back to the very dawn of maize cultivation.  In March of this year, microscopic analysis showed that grinding stones found at this site carried traces of cultivated maize that date back 8,700 years ago. This is as ancient as the oldest evidence we have for the cultivation of wheat in the fertile crescent.  The grinding stones found in the shelter were nothing fancy – just rounded river stones.  But they would have been effective enough making a rough corn meal, combined with water to make a simple porridge or made into a stiffer dough to fashion that quintessential Mexcan staple, the tortilla.  <br/><br/>

Just below the shelter we passed a tiny, unkempt corn field, which must have been very much like the field, or perhaps even the same field, from which the ancient agronomists had harvested corn to take to the shelter to grind.  Also somewhere quite near to the shelter, Teosinte, the wild ancestor of modern maize would have been brought under cultivation. Genetic analysis has placed the Balsas River subspecies of Teosinte at the root of the tree leading to all modern maize. However, the food potential of Teosinte would not have been immediately obvious, because its kernels are covered with a flinty, inedible outer covering. In the 1930s, Nobel laureate George Beadle demonstrated how Meso-Americans could have first exploited Teosinte as food.  He showed that its kernels explode when heated, casting off their flinty coats and leaving behind edible little puffballs. Teosinte almost certainly was eaten as popcorn, making it the world's first and most enduring junk food.<br/><br/>

Rather quickly, the ancient farmers would have identified stands of Teosinte that made the biggest and best tasting popcorn.  Eventually, they would have had the idea to plant seeds from some the best plants in fertile soil on the banks of tributaries of the Balsas River.  In watching the cultivated Teosinte year after year, they would have selected odd plants – less bushy ones that made harvest easier, and, of course, ones with larger cobs and less-flinty kernels.  For some time they would continued to eat the cultivated maize as popcorn, but soon enough they would have discovered the varied uses of ground maize meal.  And this is exactly the evidence provided by millstones found in the humble shelter in the Balsas River Valley.

At CIMMYT, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, we visited Suketoshi Taba, who leads the effort to conserve as many types of cultivated and wild corn as possible.  The cold storage vaults of his germplasm bank contain 26,0000 varieties of maize seed, the products of thousands of years of human-directed evolution.  Represented in this germplasm bank are about 60 indigenous races of Mexican maize – each as genetically distinct from another as humans are from chimpanzees. Frequent exchange of genes with wild Teosinte, which grows as a "weed" in cultivated maize fields, has been a major source of this fantastic genetic diversity in these founding stocks from which all maize world-wide is derived.
